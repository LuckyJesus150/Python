There are many kinds of ignorance which, for lack of time and
opportunity, we may rightly tolerate in ourselves.  Ignorance of the
stories that cling around and beautify the home-place is not one of
these.  A place, indeed, is not a home unless human life has woven a
thread of story through and through it.  Happy are those who dwell as
children in a place well clad with racy memories and legendary lore.
The city-home of the London child is just such a place.  Here we have a
city with an old old history losing itself in the mists of time, and
preserving itself in the memorials of its ancient sites and the tales
that grow like ivy round its odd place-names.  Of all this the careless
city-dweller takes no note, but the London child should be a different
kind of being.  London stories are racy of London; they reflect its
life in every age; and the London child is heir to them all.
